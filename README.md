## Opt-in features

### Expense documents

Spliit offers users to upload images (to an AWS S3 bucket) and attach them to expenses. To enable this feature:

- Follow the instructions in the _S3 bucket_ and _IAM user_ sections of [next-s3-upload](https://next-s3-upload.codingvalue.com/setup#s3-bucket) to create and set up an S3 bucket where images will be stored.
- Update your environments variables with appropriate values:

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_EXPENSE_DOCUMENTS=true
S3_UPLOAD_KEY=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
S3_UPLOAD_SECRET=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
S3_UPLOAD_BUCKET=name-of-s3-bucket
S3_UPLOAD_REGION=us-east-1
```

You can also use other S3 providers by providing a custom endpoint:

```.env
S3_UPLOAD_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
```

### Create expense from receipt

You can offer users to create expense by uploading a receipt. This feature relies on [OpenAI GPT-4 with Vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) and a public S3 storage endpoint.

To enable the feature:

- You must enable expense documents feature as well (see section above). That might change in the future, but for now we need to store images to make receipt scanning work.
- Subscribe to OpenAI API and get access to GPT 4 with Vision (you might need to buy credits in advance).
- Update your environment variables with appropriate values:

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_RECEIPT_EXTRACT=true
OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Deduce category from title

You can offer users to automatically deduce the expense category from the title. Since this feature relies on a OpenAI subscription, follow the signup instructions above and configure the following environment variables:

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CATEGORY_EXTRACT=true
OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Telegram notifications

You can send telegram notifications when expenses are created, updated or deleted. This feature requires a bot token, which can be created from telegram's [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features). To enable, set the following environment variables:

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS=true
TELEGRAM_API_URL=https://api.telegram.org
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

For a custom notification provider, you can substitute the TELEGRAM_API_URL with your own url.
Notifications will be sent as a GET request to {TELEGRAM_API_URL}/bot{TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/sendMessage with a json payload containing chat_id and text keys, where chat_id is taken from the group settings.
