# Setting Up E2E Testing with Playwright

Follow these steps to integrate Playwright for end-to-end testing in your application:

## Step 1: Install Playwright

Install Playwright along with its testing library by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
```

This command sets up Playwright to manage automated browser interactions.

## Step 2: Configure Playwright

Create a Playwright configuration file named `playwright.config.ts` at the root of your project with the following content:

```typescript
import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  testDir: './tests',
  timeout: 30000,
  retries: 1,
  use: {
    headless: true,
    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
    ignoreHTTPSErrors: true,
    video: 'on-first-retry',
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { browserName: 'chromium' },
    },
    {
      name: 'firefox',
      use: { browserName: 'firefox' },
    },
    {
      name: 'webkit',
      use: { browserName: 'webkit' },
    },
  ],
};

export default config;
```

## Step 3: Add E2E Test

Create a `tests` directory in the root of your project. Add E2E tests under this directory.

Example test file `tests/example.spec.ts`:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000'); // replace with your local dev URL
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Your App Title/); // update with your app's title
});
```

## Step 4: Update Package.json

Add a script in `package.json` for running Playwright tests:

```json
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "test:e2e": "playwright test"
  }
```

## Step 5: Run the Test

Ensure your application is running locally, then execute your tests with:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

**Additional Considerations**

- If using CI/CD, adapt Playwright settings to accommodate environment constraints.
- Manage environment variables as necessary for successful testing.
- Utilize Playwright's `global-setup.js` and `global-teardown.js` for set up and tear down logic.

Follow these steps to effectively incorporate E2E testing into your build process using Playwright. For further customization or troubleshooting, consult Playwright's documentation.
