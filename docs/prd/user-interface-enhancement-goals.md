# User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI

The conversational AI interface will become the **primary interaction method** for all Spliit functionality, prominently featured and encouraged, while traditional UI remains accessible for users who prefer it. Users will initiate actions through natural language, see visual confirmation using familiar UI patterns, then approve execution.

**Primary Flow Architecture**:
- **Conversational Input**: Prominent primary interface with clear value messaging
- **AI Intent Parsing**: Interprets user intent and extracts structured data  
- **Visual Confirmation**: Existing UI components display parsed intent for verification
- **Execution**: Upon confirmation, actions execute through existing tRPC APIs
- **Traditional Access**: Full UI functionality remains available but positioned as alternative method

## Modified/New Screens and Views

**New Primary Interface**:
- Prominent Conversational Chat Interface (featured prominently on all screens)
- Persistent chat input with helpful prompts and examples
- AI response and confirmation flow components
- Onboarding flow highlighting conversational capabilities

**Repurposed Existing Screens**:
- Traditional navigation remains fully functional
- All existing screens serve dual purpose: direct use OR confirmation interfaces
- Conversational prompts and suggestions integrated into traditional views
- Clear visual hierarchy emphasizing conversational path while preserving choice

## UI Consistency Requirements

**Conversational-Prominent Design**:
- Chat interface prominently positioned with clear benefits messaging
- Traditional navigation accessible but visually de-emphasized
- Helpful conversational examples and prompts throughout interface
- Progressive disclosure guides users toward conversational interaction while respecting user preference
