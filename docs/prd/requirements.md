# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1**: Conversational AI shall interpret natural language input for expense creation and display parsed information in a confirmation interface before execution  
**FR2**: AI shall understand balance and reimbursement queries and present results using existing display components  
**FR3**: Group management commands shall be interpreted and confirmed through existing group creation/editing interfaces  
**FR4**: Expense history queries shall leverage existing filtering and display logic with AI-parsed parameters  
**FR5**: All conversational actions shall require user confirmation before executing changes to data  
**FR6**: AI shall provide helpful error messages when intent cannot be clearly determined  
**FR7**: Conversational interface shall support all 15 existing languages for input and responses  

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: AI response time shall not exceed 3 seconds for intent interpretation  
**NFR2**: Enhancement shall reuse existing UI components for confirmation interfaces to maintain visual consistency  
**NFR3**: AI integration shall build upon existing OpenAI patterns and configuration  
**NFR4**: All existing tRPC API endpoints shall remain unchanged and be reused for data operations  
**NFR5**: Conversational features shall be progressive enhancement - existing UI remains fully functional  

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: Existing API Compatibility - All current tRPC endpoints must remain unchanged and continue serving existing UI  
**CR2**: Database Schema Compatibility - No database schema changes required; AI works with existing data structures  
**CR3**: UI/UX Consistency - Confirmation interfaces must use existing design system and components  
**CR4**: Integration Compatibility - Build upon existing OpenAI integration patterns and environment configuration
