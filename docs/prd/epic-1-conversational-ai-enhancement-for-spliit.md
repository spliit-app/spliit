# Epic 1: Conversational AI Enhancement for Spliit

**Epic Goal**: Transform Spliit into a conversational-first expense sharing application where users primarily interact through natural language while maintaining full traditional UI accessibility and leveraging Supabase-first architecture for optimal real-time conversational experiences.

**Integration Requirements**: Build upon existing OpenAI patterns, implement Supabase-first data architecture, reuse existing UI components for confirmation workflows, and maintain backward compatibility with all current functionality.

## Story 1.1: Supabase Foundation and Infrastructure Setup

**As a** developer,  
**I want** Supabase infrastructure established with proper authentication and database schema,  
**so that** the conversational AI has a robust real-time backend foundation.

## Story 1.4: Expense Creation Through Conversation

**As a** user,  
**I want** to create expenses by saying "I paid $50 for dinner with John and Jane",  
**so that** I can quickly log expenses without manual form entry.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. AI accurately parses expense amount, description, participants, and categories from natural language
2. Existing expense creation form populated with AI-extracted data for user confirmation
3. All existing expense validation rules applied to AI-suggested data
4. User can modify AI suggestions before confirming expense creation
5. Expense creation executes through existing tRPC endpoints after confirmation
6. Support for various natural language patterns for expense description

### Integration Verification
**IV1**: All existing expense creation functionality remains unchanged  
**IV2**: Expense validation, currency handling, and business logic unchanged  
**IV3**: Created expenses appear correctly in all existing expense views  
**IV4**: Expense splitting logic works identically to manual entry  

## Story 1.5: Balance and Reimbursement Queries

**As a** user,  
**I want** to ask "How much does John owe me?" and get instant answers,  
**so that** I can quickly check balances without navigating through the app.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. AI interprets balance queries and identifies specific users or general balance requests
2. Responses displayed using existing balance display components
3. Support for reimbursement status queries ("Did John pay me back?")
4. Historical balance queries with date ranges
5. Multiple response formats (specific amounts, balance summaries, recent activity)
6. Integration with existing balance calculation logic

### Integration Verification
**IV1**: Existing balance calculations and displays remain unchanged  
**IV2**: Balance accuracy maintained across all query methods  
**IV3**: Real-time balance updates continue working correctly  
**IV4**: Reimbursement tracking functions identically to existing implementation  

## Story 1.6: Group Management Through Conversation

**As a** user,  
**I want** to say "Create a new group for our Vegas trip" and have it set up automatically,  
**so that** I can efficiently manage multiple expense groups.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. AI interprets group creation requests and extracts group name and initial participants
2. Existing group creation interface populated with AI suggestions for confirmation
3. Support for group member addition/removal through conversation
4. Group settings and preferences manageable through natural language
5. Integration with existing group management and permissions system
6. Group switching and navigation through conversational commands

### Integration Verification
**IV1**: All existing group management functionality preserved  
**IV2**: Group permissions and access controls unchanged  
**IV3**: Multi-group workflows continue operating correctly  
**IV4**: Group sharing and invitation features remain intact  

## Story 1.7: Expense History and Analytics Queries

**As a** user,  
**I want** to ask "Show me all restaurant expenses this month" and get filtered results,  
**so that** I can analyze spending patterns conversationally.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. AI interprets complex filtering requests (date ranges, categories, participants, amounts)
2. Results displayed using existing expense list and filtering components
3. Support for analytical queries ("How much did we spend on food last month?")
4. Export functionality accessible through conversational commands

## Critical Story Dependencies

- Stories 1.1 and 1.2 must complete before any user-facing conversational features
- Story 1.3 provides foundation for all subsequent user interaction stories
- Stories 1.4-1.7 can be developed in parallel once foundation is established
- Story 1.8 refines and optimizes all previous conversational capabilities

## Rollback Considerations

- Each story includes feature flags for immediate disable capability
- Supabase changes isolated to avoid affecting existing data
- AI features fail gracefully to traditional UI workflows
- Database schema changes are additive only, no destructive modifications
