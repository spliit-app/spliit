# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis combined with user-provided comprehensive context

**Current Project State**: 
Spliit is a fully functional expense sharing application built with Next.js 14 and tRPC API. The app successfully handles expense splitting, balance calculations, reimbursements across 15 supported languages with i18n. It includes Progressive Web App capabilities with offline functionality and already has AI integration via OpenAI for receipt scanning. The system is production-ready and serving users effectively.

## Available Documentation Analysis

Based on the workspace structure, I can see:
✓ Tech Stack Documentation (Next.js 14, tRPC, Prisma)  
✓ Source Tree/Architecture (well-organized app structure)  
✓ API Documentation (tRPC routers structure)  
✓ External API Documentation (existing OpenAI integration)  
✓ Database Schema (Prisma migrations and schema.prisma)  
✓ i18n Implementation (15 language support)  
✓ PWA Configuration (manifest, offline capabilities)  

**Status**: Excellent existing documentation foundation from codebase analysis

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✓ New Feature Addition (Conversational AI layer)

**Enhancement Description**: 
Adding a conversational AI interface layer to enable natural language interactions for all existing Spliit functionality. Users will be able to create expenses, check balances, manage groups, view history, and handle reimbursements through conversational commands using existing UI components for confirmation interfaces before execution.

**Impact Assessment**: ✓ **Minimal to Moderate Impact** (primarily additive with existing component reuse)

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Transform existing UX into conversational AX through **confirmation-based workflow**
- Enable natural language input with **visual confirmation** before execution  
- **Reuse existing UI components** for confirmation interfaces
- Build upon existing OpenAI integration patterns for consistency
- Preserve data integrity through existing business logic **and user confirmation**

**Background Context**:
The Spliit app has proven its business logic and user workflows in production. With existing AI capabilities for receipt scanning, there's an opportunity to extend AI integration into conversational interactions. The enhancement implements a 'conversational intent → visual confirmation → execution' workflow, eliminating dual interface complexity while maintaining user confidence through familiar confirmation patterns. This approach leverages the robust foundation of tRPC APIs and business logic without requiring architectural changes.
